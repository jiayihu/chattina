#Chattina *Work still in progress*

An MVC Chat, built in native Javascript for fun and learning. No JQuery/MV* Framework dependency.

This is not meant to be used for any production since it doesn't provide polyfills to old browsers. I'm using for instance CSS Flexbox and Viewport units.

##Main libraries used:
 - [Page.js](https://github.com/visionmedia/page.js) for routing and hash management
 - [localForage](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage) for offline client Storage
 - [PubSub.js](https://github.com/mroderick/PubSubJS) for Publish/Subscribe Event System

##Browser Support
 - Evergreen browsers (IE10+)
